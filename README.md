## Device Requirements

Minimum (app + basic usage):
- Android 12 or newer
- 6 GB RAM
- 4 GB free storage for app, workspace, and model files

Recommended (comfortable local model experience):
- Android 13 or newer
- 8 GB RAM or more
- Mid-range to flagship processor
- 4-6 GB free storage (depending on model size and project assets)

Notes:
- Larger `.litertlm` models need more RAM and storage.
- First model load can take longer; later runs are usually faster.

## Installing

1. Go to the GitHub **Releases** page.
2. Download the latest APK from the most recent release.
3. Open the APK on your Android device and install it.
4. Launch **OnDevice Studio**.

## Using the App

1. Open OnDevice Studio on your device.
2. Import a compatible `.litertlm` model from the menu.
Model setup: This repository does **not** include model files, so download one first and then import it in-app.
Recommended model family: `litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm`
Model source: [Hugging Face - litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm](https://huggingface.co/litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm/tree/main)
3. Enter a prompt (example: `Build a calculator app with a clean UI`).
4. Generate and review the live preview.
5. Refine with follow-up prompts.
6. Export files when you are ready.

## Security and Privacy Notes

- Generated project files stay inside app-private storage by default.
- External web navigation is restricted in preview flow.
- Imported files/models are handled locally on-device.
